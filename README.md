# Overview of analysis
- The purpose of this analysis was to determine the temperature trends for the months of June and December to see if the weather would allow a surf shop to be economically viable all year. Furthermore, this module as a whole was used to instruct the student how to use SQL data through Python, how to clean and untangle messy data, and how to build apps using Flask.


## Results

- The descriptive statistics for June and December are presented in the analysis folder
- June and December have very similar minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures, and the differences between the two months fall under the standard deviation, except in the case of minimum temperature.

## Summary
- The results indicate that these the temperature of this area during these two months in comparable enough that it is likely a surf shop could be viable, although it should be noted December has a slightly lower minimum temperature.
- Further queries can be done to see what the level of precipitation and the wind speed is like during these months as both factors play a role in the viability of a surf shop.
